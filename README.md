Poking around with the data set from https://bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge

done:
bike id with most trips: id: 510, count: 482

ideas for things to look for:

days with fewest rentals (what is the number of rentals on the day with the smallest rentals?)

most used, least used bike

day with most, fewest trips

most often used bike id
