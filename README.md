Poking around with the data set from https://bayareabikeshare.com/datachallenge

done:
bike id with most trips: id: 510, count: 482
Most used day was: Thursday with usage of: 25265

ideas for things to look for:

days with fewest rentals (what is the number of rentals on the day with the smallest rentals?)

most used, least used bike

day with most, fewest trips

most often used bike id

average lifetime of bikes

spread of most-used and least-used bikes

longest checked out bike
longest trip?


in progress: 
day of week that bikes are most used?
